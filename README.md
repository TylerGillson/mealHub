###About MealHub:  
<p>
  Many struggle to find time to cook, while others enjoy
plenty. Mealhub is a peer-to peer local meal-sourcing platform
that connects busy and/or cash strapped people in search
of an affordable, home cooked meals (Mouths) to those interested
in monetizing their kitchens and culinary skills (Chefs). Mouths
interested in purchasing meals will be able to search for Chefs
by location. Chefs will advertise the meals they are willing to provide,
as well as meals they have currently available. Chefs can post information
such as ingredients, nuber of servings, price, and availability time for each
meal they cook. Mouths will be able to rate Chefs and individual meals based
their eating experiences. All financial transactions will be negotiated and
conducted independently between Mouths and Chefs. The MealHub platform will provide Mouths access
rare authentic food from a diverse range of cultures and ethnicities without
paying restaurant premiums and provide Chefs access to a marketplace without
investing in full scale restaraunts.
