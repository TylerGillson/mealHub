Ideas:

Don't know if this is the best place but figured we could get a
running list of ideas and what not.

Some brain storming from Richard
-Have a rating system for the cooks/specific items/meals they make rated by eaters
-have a rating system for eaters based on timelyness (general karma) rated by cookers
-cook posts what they will have by time/tyep/servings of dish
-eater can search/reserve meal to pick up by time
-eater can search by meal type 
-eater's can pre-order/request if cooks allow
-pickup/delivery options?
-possible allergens flag
